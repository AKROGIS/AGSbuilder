    # relative paths are resolved from the working directory of the process that
    # executes the script, not necessarily the location of the script.  Full paths
    # are recommended. Paths can use a unix style forward slash (/) as a directory
    # separator otherwise it must be a raw string (prefix with r) to avoid special
    # meaning of back slash (\)

    # purpose of identifying services that should be removed (no longer have a source
    # document in the root_directory (above). history_file must be a quoted file path or
    # None. If no history file is provided, the app will query the server to get a list
    # of current services to act as the history list.  Any services found on the server
    # that are not in the root_folder and/or service_list will be unpublished.
    # The file must have a header row and at least 3 columns the first of which must be
    # string values for: source_path, service_folder, service_name.

    # service_list
    # The service_list is a path to a csv file with records of the services to be published.
    # This will be considered along with the files found in the root_directory.
    # This file allows the user to publish source documents not in the root_folder, provide
    # additional or non-default publishing parameters, and to specify if the service should
    # be deleted or unconditionally re-published. service_list must be a quoted path or None.

    # string values for: TODO: define the service_list file format.

    # to 'MY_HOSTED_SERVICES'.
