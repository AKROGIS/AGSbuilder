# server can be one of the following
# A name of a server connection in ArcCatalog; i.e. server = r'GIS Servers/arcgis on inpakrovmgis_6080 (publisher)'
# A full path to an ArcGIS Server connection file (*.ags) created in ArcCatalog;
#   i.e. server = r'C:\path\to\my\connection.ags'
# A relative path (relative to the cwd of the process running the script) to an ArcGIS Server connection
#   file (*.ags) created in ArcCatalog
# 'My Hosted Services' to publish to AGOL or Portal (you must be signed in to one or the other for this to work.)

# sd_file (A service definition (.sd) contains all the information needed to publish a GIS service) can be 
# A full path to an sd file
# A relative path (relative to the cwd of the process running the script) to an sd file
# A relative path (relative to the arcpy.env.workspace setting) to an sd file

# This will publish the sd_file to the server with the following defaults (can be overridden with additional parameters) 
# the service will be created with the folder/name as specified in the sd_file
# the service will be assigned to the default cluster
# service will be started after publishing
# AGOL/Portal services will be shared per the settings in the sd_file
